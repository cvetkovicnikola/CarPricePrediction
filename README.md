<h1> 1. About the project </h1>

The main idea of this project is to get data about used cars from web site www.polovniautomobili.com and use that information to predict the price for a specific car. The application uses 2 different types of predictions, all based on current car prices on the market and characteristics of the car. Methods used for classification are Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression, and results of this process are later compared in order to find out which method is more suitable for this prediction.

<h1> 2. Linear Regression and SVR </h1>

Linear Regression is a famous technique often used in the process of data mining. This model can be very simple with only one variable as input and one as output, but of course it can have far more input variables. Basically, all this models have one or more independent variables which together produce dependent variable as a result. The regression model is used to predict the value of an unknown dependent variable.
